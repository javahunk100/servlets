2. What is polymorphism?
The ability to identify a function to run is called Polymorphism. In java, c++ there are two types of polymorphism: compile time polymorphism (overloading) and runtime polymorphism (overriding).

Mehtod overriding: Overriding occurs when a class method has the same name and signature as a method in parent class. When you override methods, JVM determines the proper methods to call at the program's run time, not at the compile time.

Method Overloading: Overloading is determined at the compile time. It occurs when several methods have same names with:

1. Different method signature and different number or type of parameters.

2. Same method signature but different number of parameters.

3. Same method signature and same number of parameters but of different type
